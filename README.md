# Hotel-Data-Analysis
# About Data
The dataset provides information on hotel reservations with 1,19,390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were canceled.

# Business Problem and Assumptions
In recent years, both Resort Hotel and City Hotel have faced significant challenges due to high cancellation rates, leading to issues such as reduced revenues and suboptimal room utilization. The primary cause of suboptimal room usage is the elevated cancellation rates, resulting in decreased revenue generation. Lowering cancellation rates is crucial for both hotels to enhance efficiency and revenue.

As a data analyst's, our responsibility is to provide comprehensive business advice to address this pressing issue. The focus of this report is on analyzing hotel booking cancellations and identifying other factors unrelated to their business that may impact yearly revenue generation.

# Conclusion
1. To mitigate reservation cancellations, hotels can adjust pricing strategies by lowering rates based on specific locations. Offering discounts to consumers is another effective approach.

2. Given the higher cancellation ratio in resort hotels compared to city hotels, offering reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends or holidays is advisable.

3. Initiating marketing campaigns in January, coupled with reasonable pricing, can help hotels increase revenue during a month with the highest cancellation rates.

4. Improving the quality of hotels and services, particularly in Portugal, can be an effective strategy to reduce cancellation rates.
